1. Used ```adjacent_find```  to perform folowing operation: 
* The first digit is not equal to the second.
* Each digit in the pair appears in s exactly as many times as its numeric value 
*   ==> [Find_Valid_Pair_of_Adjacent_Digits_in_String.cpp](https://github.com/OmMankar/Cpp_Sample_Programs/blob/main/algorithm-lib/adjacent_find/Find_Valid_Pair_of_Adjacent_Digits_in_String.cpp) 
2. Checking he parity of every pair of adjacent elements is different==> [Special_Array_I.cpp](https://github.com/OmMankar/Cpp_Sample_Programs/blob/main/algorithm-lib/adjacent_find/Special_Array_I.cpp)
